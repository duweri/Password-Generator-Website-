## 🔎 Overview

This application was built as part of a web development bootcamp challenge. The goal was to practice using JavaScript for real-world interactivity, including:
- User input (using `prompt` and `confirm`)
- Conditional logic and loops
- DOM manipulation
- Random selection from strings

---

## ✅ Features

- Fully responsive password generator
- Users can choose:
  - Password length (8–128 characters)
  - Whether to include:
    - Lowercase letters
    - Uppercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special characters
- The generated password is displayed in a text box and can be copied

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user clicks the **"Generate Password"** button.
2. The application prompts the user to choose:
   - Password length
   - Types of characters to include
3. The input is validated to ensure:
   - The length is between 8 and 128 characters
   - At least one character type is selected
4. A random password is generated from the selected character sets.
5. The password is shown on the page inside a text area.
